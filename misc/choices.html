<h1>Technology Choices</h1>
 
<p><em>Data assurance, give organizations different choices to achieve data assurance; some of the most popular ways to achieve this are:</p></em>

<p><em>- Data Masking: the original data gets replaced by fictional or scrambled values. The reason behind it is to create a non-sensitive version of the data so it can be tested or used without the risk of exposing information.</p></em>

<p><em>- Encryption: encryption techniques are used to protect the data during the transmission. This can be achieved by using an algorithm to transform normal text characters into an unreadable format.</p></em>

<p><em>- Data Erasure: A technique where software completely overwrites existing data to make it unrecoverable and to ensure that the information will not be retrieved.</p></em>

<p><em>Thanks to data assurance, it allow us to maintain data accuracy by ensuring the data to stay consistent and reliable. It safeguards the integrity of data by preventing unauthorised modifications, loss or corruption of it.</p></em>
<p><em>For organisations, this translate enhance customer trust and reputation.</p></em>

<p><em>Unfortunately, data assurance also come with some negatives, a few of the most inconvenient aspect of it are: implementing data assurance practices can be a really complex process and resource intensive. Plus, this measures can also involve significant costs for organisations to set them up. Last but now by importance, all this measures that are put in place to make sure to secure the data the best way possible, could impact that system performance, affecting the speed and efficiency of data processing.</p></em>
