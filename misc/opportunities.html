<h1><u>Opportunities</u></h1>

<h1><u>Communication of Data</u></h1>
<p>
Our research on the communication of data has provided us with a deep understanding of the technology and the risk it poses. <br> 
We have conducted an extensive research on the matter, and we will try to give a comprehensive synthesis and critique of our research regarding this topic. <br>
Communication protocols have become a vital process to ensure that data is transported safely and reliably across the network. <br>
The protocol that we focus our attention on is the Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) Protocol, a widely used protocol that simplifies the communication between the the distributed devices and play a crucial role in ensuring <br>
the sage and reliable transportation of data across the network. <br>

<h1><u>Security of Communication</u></h1>
<p>
  Our investigation into the security of communication has provided us with a sound knowledge of the topic. Data security is a critical procedure that prevents unauthorized access, corruption or theft of digital informations. <br>
Companies employ tools to protect data, and they can be: <br>
Data Masking: the original data gets replaced by fictional or scrambled values. The reason behind it is to create a non-sensitive version of the data so it can be tested or used without the risk of exposing information. <br>
Encryption: encryption techniques are used to protect the data           during the transmission. This can be achieved by using an algorithm to transform normal text characters into an unreadable format. <br>
Data Erasure: A technique where software completely overwrites existing data to make it unrecoverable and to ensure that the information wonâ€™t be retrieved. <br>
